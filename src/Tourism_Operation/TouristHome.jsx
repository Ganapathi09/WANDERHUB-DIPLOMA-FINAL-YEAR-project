            info="Udupi Shri Krishna Matha is the most famous Hindu temple in Udupi, Karnataka.
          This temple is dedicated to God Krishna and Dvaita Matha.
          It is a very popular sacred place in Karnataka. Devotees from all around the world visit this temple to seek blessings of deity Krishna and Dvaita.
          There are several temples surrounding the Krishna Matha known as Anantheshwara Temple which is over 1,000 years old and Chandramoulishwar Temple.
          Make sure to not miss the Udupi Krishna temple live darshan.
          The Krishna Matha was founded by the Vaishnavite saint Jagadguru Shri Madhvacharya in the 13th century.
          He was the founder of the Dwaita school of Vedanta. It is believed that Madhwacharya found the vigraha of Shri Krishna in a large ball of gopichandana.
          As told by Sri Madhvacharya, in his Tantrasara Sangraha, the Vigraha is placed Pashchimabhimukha (facing west).
          All the other Vigrahas in other Ashta Muthas face west as well.
          Devotees always have darshan of Lord Krishna through the inner window, known as the Navagruha Kindi & the outer window known as the Kanakana Kindi, which is decorated by an arch named after the great saint Kanakadasa.
          A statue has also been erected. A similar window covers the immediate front of the Vigraha and is called Navagraha Kindi.
          It is often mistaken to be the Kanakuna Kindi.
          The temple opens at 5:30 AM. The unique feature of the temple is that the deity is worshipped through a silver-plated window with nine holes (Navagraha Kindi).
          The temple also offers prasadam (lunch) at noon and is popularly called Anna Brahma as it feeds a vast number of devotees"

            speciality={`${<br />}${<br />} The beautiful Tulunadu which we see today was not the part of land long long back. It was the part of the ocean.
          It was Parashurama, who is said to be the sixth Avatara of Lord Vishnu according to Hindu mythology who made it a part of the land. Parashurama was 
          a Brahmin and was the son of sage Jamadagni and his wife Renuka. Once, Jamadagni ordered Parashurama to chop the head of his mother because he was angry on her.
          Parashurama being the follower of father's words, chopped his mother's head with his axe. Later when his father agreed to give him blessings, he asked Jmadagni to revive his mother.
          Jamadagni agreed and his wife came alive by his blessings. This is the early story of Parashurama.
          Parashurama hated all the Kshatriyas; so, he destroyed them all. And donated the gained land to sage Kashyapa. After donating all the land, he thought, staying in the donated land 
          is not right. So, he went on to Sahyadri to start a meditation on Lord Shiva. Shiva appeared before him and said, he would incarnate in Kadri which was then called Kadalivana and asked Parashurama to meditate there. 
          When Parashurama came to Kadalivana, it was occupied by the ocean. So, Parashurama went to the Ocean King and asked him to take back the ocean from that part of the land. When the ocean king refused to do so, 
          Parashurama threw his axe to an extent in anger. By the fear of Parashurama's anger, the ocean king took back the ocean from that much place where the axe had fallen. 
          This was how the Tulunadu was formed and so, it was called The Parashurama Srishti or Parashurama Kshetra.`}

          the son of the first Tirthankara, Lord Adinatha. According to Jain mythology, Lord Bahubali 
          attained enlightenment after meditating for a year standing on one leg, with his arms raised above his head."

            speciality={`Baahubali was the son of first Jain Tirthankara â€“ Rishabhnath or Adinath. It is said that Adinath had 100 sons. But Bahubali and Bharat Chakravartin were the two main contenders to his legacy. 
          Adinath divided his kingdom and gave the northern kingdom to Bharat who ruled from Ayodhya or Ayodhyapuri.
          It is also referred to as Vinita in some texts. The southern kingdom was given to him.${<br />}
          When Bharat tried to be the Chakravarti or the king who rules all four directions, he went around the world and conquered all kingdoms. However, he still had to win his brotherâ€™s. 
          All brothers except he conceded. Two brothers then fought in all kinds of ways and Bahubali was the winner.${<br />}
          However, as soon as he won he was dejected. He felt guilty for defeating his own elder brother. He went to Mount Kailash and meditated in standing position on the mountain. And he was 
          so still that vegetation and ant hills grew around his legs and his body became part of the place he was standing on. A year later his brother Bharat came and prayed to him â€“ at which point he was liberated of his guilt. 
          Metaphorically, he won over his own vices and attained the ultimate knowledge. He was liberated and he became a Siddha.
          ${<br />}Standing posture of his is known as Kayotsarga. Jain Tirthankaras can be seen in two postures while meditating â€“ sitting in lotus pose or Kayotsarga.
          ${<br />}There are about 500 steps to climb â€“ being small steps, they are not very difficult to climb. The intriguing bit is that you cannot see the statue until you have almost climbed 
          all the steps. If the weather is good, climbing can be fun, as you see the lush green landscape around the hill. As you go up, the view changes.`}
